## ✨ Motivation

### **What is the modality imbalance challenging in multimodal learning?**

Multimodal Learning (MML) is expected to achieve better performance compared with unimodal approaches. However, contrary to expectations, MML has been surprisingly shown to underperform compared to unimodal ones in certain scenarios. **Capability discrepancies across heterogeneous models play a crucial role in causing modality imbalance.**

## 📖 Overview

### **What do we do to balance the model capability?**

We propose AUG approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities. Firstly, we propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors. Subsequently, we introduce an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of the weak modality. We mitigate the imbalance issue as shown in the following figure.
